The printed-out letter grade is 'U' because gradeLetter 

was set to 'U' inside the class Grade 

  

  

The letter grade was set to 'A' so when gradeLetter was printed 

it printed  

  

The new object Grade can store any letter, symbol or a number  

from 0 to 65535 

  

  

Assignment Questions 

  

1. In java all variables have to be defined clearly and can not be 

changed to a different type Afterwords. 

you cannot use a string variable to do a math calculation or a number  

variable to store a word  

  

2. 

Encapsulation prevents implementation details from being  

seen by code outside of the encapsulated code. It is a form 

of data hiding and abstraction. It allows a programmer  

to use a class without having to know its implementation. 

  

A constructor initializes objects. A constructor is called a 

 Default constructor when it doesn't have any parameters.  

The name of the constructor is always the same as the class.  

  

An accessor method accesses data in an object without  

changing the object. 

  

A mutator method modifies the data in an object. 

  

An instance variable is declared inside the class and outside  

The scope of any method. the value of an instance variable can 

 be changed by any method in the class, but it is not accessible 

from outside the class. 



Object Reference refers to an object. It is the memory  

Location of an object.  

  

  
Built-ins or Primitives are the most fundamental data type. 

There are 8 primitive data types: Boolean, byte,  

character, short, int, long, float, and double. 

  

3. The main method is executed first by a Java application. 

 

4. The compiler translates high-level languages into machine code  

required by the CPU. 

5. 

The class Grade belongs to the package edu.monmouth.grade 

The instance variable is gradeLetter 

There are two constroctors  

public Grade() { 

		gradeLetter = 'U'; 

	} 

	
and 

	public Grade(char gradeLetter) { 

		this.gradeLetter = gradeLetter; 

 

	
The accessor method 

	public char getGradeLetter() { 

		return gradeLetter; 

	} 

 

The mutator method 

public void setGradeLetter(char gradeLetter) { 

		this.gradeLetter = gradeLetter; 

	 

	} 

 

This code does not compile because double quotes
cannot be used for a char they are use for a 
string
